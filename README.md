## Node Monitor
A simple package to grab compartmental data.

## Installation
Right now it's not public because I don't think this is the version I want published. 

Right now running the way it is, it can be system heavy. Which is what I don't want. I think it could be improved to work similarly, but with less system resources.

If you really want to give this a go, clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:austinkregel/node-monitor`, and then a `npm install`. 

## How to use
`node index.js`
